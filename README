Steps that need to be done:
* install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install the LTS version. Install this with default settings.
* unpack the zip file
* edit dist/config.json . (sleeptime is in minutes, first time pnl is 0 that will be updated the next run). Do not edit the PNL! It is a JSON file, multiple accounts are supported, also Binance/Finandy.
* assuming you are running on Windows: Rightclick the startFundTransfer.bat ,properties, unblock if needed). Then run the bat file. First time it will download needed files and starts running.

** IMPORTANT! **
This system uses the exchange balance to check. So when you add funds, this will be seen as profit.
To solve this, after adding the funds to your account edit the config.json and modify the pnl to the current balance.
